0. The origin of tool name

Chanam Park is my name and this tool is developed to assessment of software security.
So, Chanam PARK's ASSessment -> CPARKASS
This is just in case that you would think the word ¡®ASS¡¯ as a strange means. You know. ;-)


1. Introduction

Cparkass is a convenient tool for the security assessment or fuzzing which is developed by python.

The concept is very simple.

Suppose someone wants to verify the software¡¯s vulnerability which is processing some file formats.

In that case, you can use this tool.

Cparkass is using crafted files as a database that was succeeded either to occur crash or to exploit particular software before.

For example, if you want to find or to check the vulnerability in specific movie player,

cparkass can perform the security assessment of the software with own database which is composed of crafted files like an avi, wmv, pdf, etc.

To sum up, cparkass conducts such a high probability fuzz testing by the pattern-based database.

FYI, this is only for Windows platform yet.


2. Help

You can see the help message as follows
./cparkass -h
./cparkass --help


2. Update

Update all patterns
./cparkass -u

Update specific pattern
./cparkass -u [pattern]
Ex> ./cparkass -u pdf

Update more than one pattern
./cparkass -u [pattern/pattern/pattern/...]
Ex> ./cparkass -u avi/wmv


3. Assessment software

Assessment with all patterns
./cparkass -t [target path]
Ex> ./cparkass -t C:\music_player\listen.exe

Assessment with specific pattern
./cparkass -t [target path] -p [pattern]
Ex> ./cparkass -t C:\doc_editor\mx_office.exe -p doc

Assessment with more than one pattern
./cparkass -t [target path] -p [pattern]
Ex> ./cparkass -t C:\doc_editor\mx_office.exe -p doc/ppt/xls


4. Other options

-l (--lapse) option
To Set the waiting time in seconds before to exit the target program(default value is 5).
- All of the computers are not having a same time to run specific software. That's why this option is provided.
Ex> ./cparkass -t C:\music_player\listen.exe -l 3

-v (--verbose) option
To get a detailed information.
Ex> ./cparkass -t C:\music_player\listen.exe -v
